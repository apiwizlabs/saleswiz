Branching Convention:

Convention: `<Type>-<Issue_ID>`

Example:
```javascript
    feat-12 /** Describes a branch with issue no: 12 and a feature request */
```

Where `Type` can be:
| Type | Description |
| :---   | :--- |
| feat | Issue of feature type |
|doc | Any Documentation changes|
| fix | Any Bug fixes|
